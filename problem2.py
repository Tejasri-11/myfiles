"""A digital machine generates binary data which consists of a string of 0s and 1s. A maximum signal M, in the data, consists of the maximum number of either 1s or 0s appearing consecutively in the data but M canâ€™t be at the beginning or end of the string. Design a way to find the length of the maximum signal.

Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer N, representing the length of the binary string. The second line consists of a string of length N consisting of 0s and 1s only.

Output
Print an integer representing the length of the maximum signal."""
